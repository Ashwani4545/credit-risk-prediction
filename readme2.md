# AegisBank — Loan Default Prediction System

The AI Loan Default Prediction System is a machine learning--based web application designed to help financial institutions evaluate the risk of loan applicants. The system predicts whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan by analyzing historical borrower and loan data using machine learning models.

Traditional credit scoring systems rely heavily on static financial records and often exclude individuals with limited credit history. This project introduces an AI‑driven approach that improves prediction accuracy while ensuring transparency and explainability.

The system integrates: - XGBoost-based predictive modeling - Explainable AI techniques - Flask-based web application

This creates a complete intelligent credit risk assessment platform.

## Setup & Usage

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Place your dataset
Put your LendingClub-format CSV at:
```
data/raw/loan_data.csv
```
Required target column: `loan_status`

### 3. Preprocess data
```bash
python -m src.data_preprocessing
```

### 4. Train models
```bash
python -m src.train_model
```
This trains Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
Best model (by ROC-AUC) is saved to `models/loan_default_model.pkl`.  
Metrics are saved to `model_metrics.json`.

### 5. Save feature list (required for Flask app)
```bash
python -m utils.preprocessor
```

### 6. (Optional) Evaluate standalone
```bash
python -m src.evaluate_model
```

### 7. Run the web app
```bash
python app.py
```
Open http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Pages

| URL | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `/` | Loan assessment form |
| `/predict` | POST — runs model, saves to history |
| `/dashboard` | Model metrics, confusion matrix, radar chart |
| `/history` | Filterable prediction log |
| `/reports` | Borrower report cards |
| `/reports/<id>` | Individual printable report |
| `/api/metrics` | JSON metrics |
| `/api/history` | JSON history (supports `?q=` search) |
| `/health` | Healthcheck |

## Data Flow

```
Raw CSV → data_preprocessing.py → cleaned_data.csv
         → train_model.py       → model.pkl + metrics.json + features.pkl
         → app.py               → /predict → history.json
                                          → result.html
```

The dashboard displays metrics from `model_metrics.json` — the exact same
values produced during training. No divergence between training and UI.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Model selection by ROC-AUC** (not accuracy) — better for imbalanced classes
- **Feature alignment** — model features extracted at training time and saved to `model_features.pkl`; inference always aligns to this list to prevent feature mismatch
- **Column sanitization** — XGBoost-safe column names (no `[]<>` chars) applied identically in training and inference
- **History** — JSON file (swap for SQLite/Postgres in production)
- **Print-ready reports** — `report_detail.html` has `@media print` styles
